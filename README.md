# Crypto.com-Exchange-Price-Guide

What it calculates:
- Mouseover/hover price divided by current price. Gives a small 4-digit percentage (eg. -0.0013%), displayed dynamically in the hover overlay.
- First buy order price below ticker divided by first ask order price above ticker. Gives a small positive5-digit percentage (eg. 0.00204%) displayed on right side of ticker. Signifies the percentage "gap" between buy and ask.

What it does not do:
- Trade. It only calculates and displays values to assist you.
- Save anything, neither locally nor on any server. It only stores variables that it needs to work.
- Read you accounts details. It only reads values within the trading window, specifically the ticker and first offers above and below.

Additional things it does not do:
- No coffee brewing or delivery service.
- Can't predict the weather, ever.
- No bug teleportation function, yet.
- Code won't order pizza, sadly.
- No built-in dance function, sorry.
